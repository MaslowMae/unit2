Unit Two : Challenge Accepted!

Here you will see a leverage of things we learned this week in HTML and Advanced CSS.

This is site complete with header, responsive navigation items and minimal animation/transformations to enhance the overall look. 

The site is divided into two sections of content, "main" and "aside". The main encapsulates a short bio and a list of project examples as the portfolio, and listed credentials at the bottom with an isolated embedded link that states "top of page" which will take the user to the top of the page. 

The right side holds a contact form, so that contact requests have an easy way to be organized and followed up on or tracked. Rather than list contact details, there are links provided for Linkedin and Github for further contact and connection if they did not want to personally reach out. 

You will notice Javascript project is not yet completed and will be updated soon when we get to this part of the course and also will be helpful in making the form interactive with a data house for the contact form and its updates. 

This site was created for laptop screens and mobile phones and should be responsive to the types. Google Chrome is the most compatible browser to be used for highest quality of usage of this site. 

Thank you!
